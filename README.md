# Snake Glitched

Snake Glitched is a unique take on the classic 1997 Snake game, developed in Python for a college project. The game introduces a storyline where viruses attack the computer, and the snake (player) must consume their code to remove them from the system.

## Fun Things

1. All **music** in the game was created by me!
2. The art was kindly done by **Nooby Arts**!
3. AI was used for the **voice lines** (*cause I am no voice actor*)
4. That glitch effect took me almost **two weeks** (*The pain!!!*)
5. Some assets were created using **Canva**
6. I am so far **the only person** who has ever beaten the game (*Proud*)

## Bugs and Glitches
I am aware of only one bug at this current time.
It is on the last two stages, where enemies can overlap items or even the folders!
I am not planning on fixing this as I am putting this project on here as I presented it to my class.
I am proud of this project, even if it has a few flaws, but the bugs remind me that there is always somewhere I can improve!
